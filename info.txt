Uses flaskrest.service which is located in /etc/systemd/system this is the service that connects apache to gunicorn and python. This is what creates the flaskrest.sock file ie the socket file letting you send post requests
Has flaskrest.conf in /etc/apache2/sites-available
Log files are coming from the logger in pyhton index file and gunicorn logging from gunicorn_conf.py
